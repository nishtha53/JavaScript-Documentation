- Object oriented programming is programming paradigm based on the concepts of objects.

- We use object to model real world or abstract features.

## Classes and Instances

## Four Fundamental OOP principals

- Abstaction

- Encapsulation

- Inheritence

- Polymorphism

**1) Abstaction**

- It means ignoring or hiding details that doesn't matter, allowing us to get an overview perspective of thing we are implementing, instead of messing with details that really don't matter to our implementation.
